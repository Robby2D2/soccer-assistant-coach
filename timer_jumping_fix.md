# Timer Jumping Fix

## Problem Identified

The timer was jumping around once it went past the half duration because of conflicting time calculation methods:

### Root Cause
1. **Dual Time Calculation**: The timer was using both simple incrementing AND background time calculation on every tick
2. **Frequent Recalculation**: `calculateCurrentGameTime()` was being called every second, which recalculates based on database stored time + elapsed time
3. **Timing Mismatches**: Small delays or timing differences between the increment and the database calculation caused jumps
4. **Home Screen Issues**: The home screen was rebuilding FutureBuilders frequently due to database updates every 5 seconds

## Solutions Implemented

### âœ… **Fixed Traditional Game Screen Timer Logic**
- **Before**: Called `_updateGameTimeFromBackground()` every second, which recalculated from database
- **After**: Uses simple increment (`_gameTime = _gameTime + 1`) for normal operation
- **Background Calculation**: Only used when actually resuming from background state

```dart
// Old problematic approach
_updateGameTimeFromBackground(); // Called every second!

// New stable approach  
setState(() {
  _gameTime = _gameTime + 1; // Simple, predictable increment
});
```

### âœ… **Optimized Home Screen Time Display**
- **Before**: Used FutureBuilder with `calculateCurrentGameTime()` that recalculated on every rebuild
- **After**: Calculates current time once per rebuild using direct DateTime calculation
- **Reduced FutureBuilder Complexity**: Simplified from dual Future.wait to single future

```dart
// Calculate once per rebuild, not in FutureBuilder
final gameTimeForDisplay = game.isGameActive && game.timerStartTime != null
    ? game.gameTimeSeconds + DateTime.now().difference(game.timerStartTime!).inSeconds
    : game.gameTimeSeconds;
```

### âœ… **Preserved Background Persistence**
- **App Lifecycle Monitoring**: Still handles background/foreground transitions
- **Resume Logic**: Uses `calculateCurrentGameTime()` only when returning from background
- **State Persistence**: Timer start time and game time still saved to database

## Technical Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smooth Timer Operation**
- **Predictable Increments**: Timer now increments smoothly without jumps
- **Consistent Display**: Both game screen and home screen show stable time progression
- **Proper Overtime**: "+MM:SS" format displays correctly without timing artifacts

### ðŸŽ¯ **Maintained Functionality**  
- **Background Persistence**: Still works when app goes to background
- **State Recovery**: Properly resumes when returning from background
- **Database Sync**: Game time still periodically saved (every 5 seconds)

### ðŸŽ¯ **Performance Improvements**
- **Reduced Database Calls**: No longer calls `calculateCurrentGameTime()` every second
- **Simpler Home Screen**: Fewer FutureBuilder recalculations
- **Better Resource Usage**: Less CPU overhead from constant recalculation

## Testing Scenarios

### âœ… **Normal Operation**
- Timer counts smoothly: 19:59, 19:58, 19:57...
- Transitions to overtime: 00:01, 00:00, +00:01, +00:02...
- No more jumping or erratic behavior

### âœ… **Background Persistence** 
- App backgrounds during timer â†’ continues counting
- App returns â†’ shows correct elapsed time
- Playing times properly accumulated during background

### âœ… **Home Screen Display**
- Shows consistent time remaining format
- Updates smoothly without FutureBuilder flashing
- Matches game detail screen time display

The timer now operates smoothly and predictably while maintaining all background persistence functionality.
