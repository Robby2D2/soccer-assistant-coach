    <section>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Soccer Assistant Coach (the "App") is a mobile application that helps coaches and team managers plan games, manage rosters, track simple metrics, and export/import data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and store information when you use the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The App stores team and player information locally on your device.</li>
        <li>The App does not require an account or sign-in.</li>
        <li>The App does not show ads and does not collect analytics by default.</li>
        <li>You control any sharing or export (for example, CSV export or using the Android share sheet).</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <h3>1) Information you provide</h3>
      <p>Team names, player names, contact notes, match lineups, and other content you enter into the App. Optional media (photos) you may attach to players or teams via the device image picker.</p>
      <p><strong>How it's used:</strong> to display and manage your teams and games inside the App. This data is stored on your device and is not transmitted anywhere by default.</p>

      <h3>2) Technical / Device information</h3>
      <p>The App may access basic device identifiers that platform APIs expose to enable plugin functionality (for example, platform-specific plugins like device info). These are used only as required by included plugins and not collected centrally by the app.</p>
      <p><strong>How it's used:</strong> to provide library/plugin compatibility; not used to build a centralized profile.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Third-party services</h2>
      <p>The app includes open-source third-party libraries (listed in <code>pubspec.yaml</code>). Some of these libraries may request temporary access to device features (camera, file storage) to let you pick images or export files. The App does not send collected personal data to external analytics or advertising providers by default.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Image picker: allows selecting a photo from the device to attach to a player.</li>
        <li>Share/export: the CSV export feature uses the platform share dialog to let you save or send exports; the receiving app or service will then handle that data separately.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Data sharing and export</h2>
      <p>You can export team and game data (CSV). When you export or share, that data is transferred via the platform share sheet or saved to a file you choose. The App itself does not transmit exported data to any remote server.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>Data you enter is retained on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App. The App does not maintain server-side backups. If you export data yourself, that export persists according to the storage location you chose.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We follow standard mobile development practices to keep local data safe. Because data is stored locally, device-level protections (screen lock, backups, encrypted storage) affect the security of the data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>The App is not targeted specifically at children. If you are a parent and your child uses the App, please supervise and review any personal information they enter.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. The effective date at the top indicates the last update.</p>
    </section>
